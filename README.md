# WaniKani-HideEnglishTranslation
A small chromium extension that hides the English translation for context sentences on the WaniKani website.

# Why?
By default the english translation is shown below the Japanese sentence.
The proximity of the translation made it tougher to attempt to translate the Japanese on my own.
I made this tiny extension to add a button to toggle the visibility of the English sentence,
allowing me to check my own abilities easier.
